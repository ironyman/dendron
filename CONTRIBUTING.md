If you would like to contribute to the development of Dendron, checkout out the [Dendron repo](https://link.dendron.so/github) from GitHub.

You can then follow the [Dendron Plugin Quickstart](https://docs.dendron.so/notes/64f0e2d5-2c83-43df-9144-40f2c68935aa) to get started with development.

A great place to start is with issues labelled with the [size.small](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/size.small) label on GitHub. These are small, self contained tasks that are well suited for first time contributors.

Leave a comment in the issue if you decide to work on it. Issues that are being worked on will be assigned to a person already.

The development process for dendron is described in [here](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/7aFrHnTNespaRzhlTwftM.html).
Remember that you are always welcome to ask for help inside the [#dev Discord channel](https://link.dendron.so/discord).

# Setup project
```
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
yarn
yarn setup
```
This builds a lot of stuff including what actually builds this project, `dendron-cli.js`. To only build `dendron-cli.js` run
```
npx lerna run build --parallel --scope "@dendronhq/dendron-cli";
yarn setup:cli
```
The second line makes the js files executable.

# Inner loop
After the project is initialized, open VS Code and run command `Open Workspace from file`, choose the `dendron-main.code-workspace`. This loads `launch.json` configs from `packages/plugin-core` which contains the main extension. You can use the `Run Extension: Local (plugin-core)` from the launch configs of that project to test changes.

# Building vsix

Run this in project root to build an output for mac.
```
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/node_modules/.bin
export FAST=1
export SKIP_SENTRY=1
bash bootstrap/scripts/buildNightly.sh darwin-arm64 # output at packages/plugin-core/nightly-darwin-arm64-0.124.78.vsix
```
